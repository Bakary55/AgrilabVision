#  AgrilabVision – Soil Analysis & Fertility App Developed by **Bakary Coulibaly** AgrilabVision is an intelligent mobile application that helps farmers analyze soil, determine crop suitability, receive fertilizer recommendations, and optimize irrigation using **AI-powered image analysis**

This project aims to bring **affordable agricultural decision-making tools** to rural communities with limited access to laboratories and experts. 

📘 About the Project AgrilabVision uses: - **Computer Vision (TensorFlow Lite)** to analyze soil texture and moisture - **Weather APIs** to determine agricultural seasons - **Rule-based & AI-driven engines** to recommend crops, fertilizers, and irrigation - **Offline mode** for rural areas - **Cloud synchronization** when network becomes available 
 Features  Soil Analysis - Capture soil images using the smartphone camera - Detect texture: *clay, sand, silt* - Estimate organic matter and surface moisture
 
*Crop Recommendation Engine - Suggest crops adapted to season + soil + moisture - Intelligent scoring of crop suitability 
*Irrigation Advisory - Detect when the user should water their crops - Warnings for over-watering or drought risks �
*Fertilizer Recommendation Engine - Suggest optimal fertilizers for each crop - Warn users about over-fertilization 
*Additional Features - Offline mode - History of analyses - Automatic sync - Simple UI adapted for rural users
